# Mid-bootcamp-project
YouTube is for sure a place on the internet where clickbait make a huge difference. Words in title of videos can change attitude of viewers and depend how many of them click on the video.

5-Minute Crafts is a DIY-style YouTube channel owned by TheSoul Publishing. As of October 2021, it is the 9th most-subscribed channel on the platform, It is also one of the most viewed channels. The channel has drawn criticism for unusual and potentially dangerous life hacks and its reliance on clickbait. Irrespective of the criticism, 5-Minute Crafts videos do get a lot of views.

I’ve been a long subscriber of the channel and have enjoyed watching their short, engaging videos. In this project  I will analyse titles of almost 5,000  5-Minute Crafts videos on YouTube to find what attributes of title impact the number of views and I’ll build a model which predicts number of views  based only on title.
